         <h3>RECIPE</h3>
         <p>INGREDIENTS:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>4 chicken leg quarters, skinless</li>
            <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala spice mix</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika or Kashmiri red chili powder (for color)</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
            
         </ul>
         <p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Make deep cuts in the chicken leg quarters to allow the marinade to penetrate. This helps the flavors infuse better</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, tandoori masala spice mix, ginger paste, garlic paste, lemon juice, cumin powder, paprika or red chili powder, and salt. Adjust the spice level to your preference.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken leg quarters with the marinade, making sure to get the mixture into the cuts you made earlier. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2-4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to meld and the chicken to tenderize.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). If using a tandoor, preheat it according to its instructions.</li>
            <li>Place a wire rack on a baking sheet and lightly grease it. This will prevent the chicken from sticking.</li>
            <li>Arrange the marinated chicken leg quarters on the wire rack, allowing any excess marinade to drip off.</li>
            <li>Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. You can also finish by broiling for an additional 2-3 minutes to get a slightly charred effect.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve the Tandoori Chicken hot with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your homemade Tandoori Chicken as an appetizer or main course, accompanied by naan bread, rice, or a refreshing side salad.</li>
         
         </ol>
         <em>NOTE:If you have access to a grill, you can also grill the marinated chicken over medium-high heat until cooked through and slightly charred, which adds an extra layer of smoky flavor. </em>
