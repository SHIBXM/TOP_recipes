    <h3>RECIPE</h3>
    <p>INGREDIENTS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup basmati rice</li>
      <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped nuts-almonds, pistachios, or cashews</li>
      <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika or Kashmiri red chili powder (for color)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
      <li>Raisins for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak
        the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the ghee over medium heat. Add the drained
        rice and sauté for 2-3 minutes until the rice turns slightly
        translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the whole milk and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to
        low and let the rice simmer, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using saffron, soak the saffron strands in a tablespoon of warm milk.
        After a few minutes, add the saffron milk to the rice mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue simmering the rice in milk, stirring occasionally, until the
        rice is cooked and the mixture thickens. This may take about 30-40
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sugar and cardamom powder to the rice mixture. Stir well to
        combine and let it simmer for another 10-15 minutes until the sugar
        dissolves and the kheer thickens further.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate small pan, lightly roast the chopped nuts until they
        become fragrant. Keep a close eye on them to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the kheer reaches your desired consistency, turn off the heat. Stir
        in the roasted nuts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the kheer to cool slightly before serving. It will continue to
        thicken as it cools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the kheer warm or chilled, garnished with more chopped nuts and
        raisins if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
